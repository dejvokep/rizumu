The gameplay screen is divided into 4 sectors, which represent the 4 ordinal compass directions. As the music plays, notes arise from edges of the screen. The goal is to press the corresponding keyboard key when it hits the player and release it when it passes. The game tracks all your steps and contructs simple analytics, which can be viewed when a track ends, where you'll also be given a grade depending on your accuracy - D, C, B, A or S (the best).
